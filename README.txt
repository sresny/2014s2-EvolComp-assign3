2014s2-EvolComp-assign3
=======================
Final assignment for the subject of Evolutionary Computation, semester 2, 2014, University of Adelaide.
=======================

Notes and Instructions:
* Q1 contains the results of simulations for exercise 1. 
  - Q1/Question1.odt contains the visualisations for the task. 
  - Folders within Q1 (named as ProblemName_PopulationSize_NumberOfGenerations) contain the logs and numerical results, as well as the source spreadsheets, for each simulation.
* For Q2, TTP and TTPSolutionType were adapted from JMetal classes
* For Q3, TTPBitFlipMutation, TTPSwapMutation and TTPTwoPointsCrossover were implemented.
* For experiments of Q4 and Q5, main.java provides the test driver
	Usage: java main FILENAME POPULATION_SIZE NUMBER_OF_GENERATIONS ALG
	The algorithm is a choice of NSGAII, SPEA2, IBEA.
